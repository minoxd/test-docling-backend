## Definitions:

- Sepals -The outermost part of the flower, often green but sometimes looking like petals, that usually enclose the flower bud before it opens.
- Petals - The inner ring of the flower that tend to be brightly colored and often function to attract pollinators.
- Stamen - The male part of the flower that serves to produce pollen; it is composed of the pollen-bearing anther and the stalk-like filament.
- Pistil The female part of the flower that typically consists of the stigma at the top which receives the pollen, the narrow style , and the ovary which contains ovules that will later develop into seeds.

## Notes:

Composite flowers can be made of all ray flowers that look like the petals of a 'normal' flower (e.g. dandelions), all small knobby disk flowers (e.g. thistles), or both types (like this one, Green and Gold). The single petal on a ray flower is called a ligule . On both ray and disk flowers, the pollen-producing anthers are typically fused together into a tube; on a disk flower, the petals are also typically fused. The pistil , commonly with two curling lobes, emerges as each disk or ray flower matures. In Green and Gold, the ray flowers are lacking stamens (pistillate).
